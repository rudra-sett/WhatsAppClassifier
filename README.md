# WhatsAppClassifier
A Python script that takes an entire WhatsApp chat and learns to classify the messages by speaker.

This is meant to be used for group chats. WhatsApp has an option to download the entire chat as a text file. This script will learn off of that text file. The result is that you can come up with a new sentence, and the program will guess which person would be most likely to say that.
